These are two open source graphing calculators that I built for my AP Calculus BC course in 2014. One version is a Java applet, and the other is an HTML5 web app.

The Java applet uses an external class to parse equations. One alternative that also worked was running a Javascript engine inside the Java application and using the Javascript eval function to parse strings. That's a little bit more dangerous, but it would also do the trick.

Let me know if there's anything unclear about the code. I'm happy to help.
